    "        - Compare data points to known data points, or instead by detecting patterns in the training data and creating a predictive model (instance-based versus model-based learning)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Supervised/Unsupervised Learning**:\n",
    "        - The systems can be classified according to the amount and type of supervision they get during training. Categories: **Supervised, Unsupervised, Semisupervised and Reinforcement Learning.**\n",
    "        - Supervised: data labelled\n",
    "        - Unsupervised: data unlabeled, most important algorithms:\n",

    "            - Evaluating a model is simple enough: just use a test set. How to choose a value of Hyperparameter? example: regularization Hyperparameter?\n",
    "        - Data Mismatch\n",
    "    - **No Free Lunch Theorem**: A model is a simplified version of the observations. To decide what data discard and what data to keep, you must make assumptions. For example, a linear model makes the assumption that the data is fundamentally linear and that the distance between the instances and the straight line is just a noise, wich can safely ignored. If you make absolutely no assumption about the data, the there is no reason to prefer one model over any other. This is called the *No Free Lunch* (NFL) theorem. For some datasets the best model is a linear model, while for other datasets it is a neural network. The only way to know for sure which model is best is to evaluate them all. Since this is note possible, in practice you make same reasonable assumptions about the data and evaluate only a few reasonable models. For example, for simple tasks you may to evaluate linear models with various levels of regularization, and for a complex problem you may evaluate various neural networks."
